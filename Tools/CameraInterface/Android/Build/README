How to use in your own project:

1) Add sdk.dir and ndk.dir paths to the local.properties file
2) Build the Camera Interface with "gradlew assembleRelease"
3) Copy the bin/aar/build.aar inside the libs/ directory of your project.
3) Add the following lines in your project's Android.mk:
	# This variable points to the CameraInterface directory
	CAMERA_INTERFACE_DIR := /path/to/SDK/Tools/CameraInterface/Android/jni
	# Include the CameraInterface headers
	LOCAL_C_INCLUDES += $(CAMERA_INTERFACE_DIR)
	# Link with the libCameraInterface.so
	LOCAL_SHARED_LIBRARIES := CameraInterface
	# Build libCameraInterface.so (place this line after "include $(BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY)
	include $(CAMERA_INTERFACE_DIR)/Android.mk
4) That's it! :-)
