How to use in your own project:

1) Add sdk.dir and ndk.dir paths to the local.properties file
2) Build the PVR Camera Interface with "gradlew assembleRelease"
3) Copy the bin/aar/build.aar inside the libs/ directory of your project.
3) Add the following lines in your project's Android.mk:
	# This variable points to the PVRCamera directory
	PVR_CAMERA_DIR := /[path to SDK]/Framework/PVRCamera/Android/jni
	# Include the PVRCamera headers
	LOCAL_C_INCLUDES += $(PVR_CAMERA_DIR)
	# Link with the libPVRCamera.so
	LOCAL_SHARED_LIBRARIES := PVRCamera
	# Build libPVRCamera.so (place this line after "include $(BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY)
	include $(PVR_CAMERA_DIR)/Android.mk
4) That's it! :-)
