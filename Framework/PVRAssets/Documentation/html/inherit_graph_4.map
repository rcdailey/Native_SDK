It is mainly a Node structure, allowing various different kinds of data to be stored in the Nodes. The class contains a tree&#45;like structure of Nodes. Each Node can be a Mesh node (containing a Mesh), Camera node or Light node. The tree&#45;structure assumes transformational hierarchy (as usual). Transformations are expressed through Animation objects (a static transform is an animation with a single frame) There is an implicit order in the nodes &#45; First in the array the Mesh nodes will be laid out, then Camera and Light nodes.
