Glass

:ShortDescription:
Demonstrates dynamic reflection and refraction using a dual paraboloid environment map.

:FullDescription:	
This example shows a technique to maintain a dynamic environment map by rendering both hemispheres of the scene to two halves of a single rectangular texture. In addition, this also demonstrates rendering skyboxes with a full screen quad, reflection and refraction with chromatic dispersion. Shaders available for OpenGL ES 2.x and 3.x.

:APIS:
OpenGL ES 2.0/3.0

:Controls:
	-	Quit	-	Close the application
	-	Left/Right - Change the effect between combinations of Reflection and Refraction/Chromatic Dispersion
	-	Up/Down	-	Look up or down.
