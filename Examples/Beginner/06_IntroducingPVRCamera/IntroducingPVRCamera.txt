IntroducingPVRCamera

:ShortDescription:
Use the PVRCamera library to get the hardware camera of a device, and apply a simple color inversion shader to it.

:FullDescription:
The PVRCamera library gives a very simple, unified API to access the video feed of an iOS or Android device as a PVRApi (or OpenGL ES) texture. This demo displays this texture on the screen using a very simple shader that inverts the colours.

:APIS:
OpenGL ES 2.0
