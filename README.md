# PowerVR Graphics Native SDK #
![SDKExamples](http://powervr-graphics.github.io/Native_SDK/Documentation/SDKBrowser/images/ExamplesPageGraphic.png)
This repository contains the PowerVR Graphics cross-platform native (C++) SDK source code. The SDK includes optimized example applications to demonstrate the most efficient ways of implementing common 3D graphics effects on PowerVR graphics cores. It also includes a cross-platform OS and graphics API abstraction layer, and a library of helper code for resource loading, vector and matrix maths, text printing and more.

The SDK supports iOS, Android and Linux PowerVR devices. It also supports Windows, OS X and Linux PC emulation. Imagination's OpenGL ES emulation library, PVRVFrame, can be downloaded from our website [here](http://community.imgtec.com/developers/powervr/tools/pvrvframe/).

## About the SDK ##
### Framework ###
The PowerVR Graphics SDK provides a framework which is made up of PVRShell and PVRTools. PVRShell is a simple, light-weight architecture for the barebones of application setup, shutdown and event handling. It is designed to streamline the process of writing cross-platform graphics applications. PVRTools, on the other hand, is a cross-platform tools library containing the most commonly used functionality in a 3D graphics application.

### Example Applications ###
The examples provided in the SDK are fully commented, highly optimized C++ applications that cover a variety of rendering techniques. They are designed in a step-by-step tutorial style to gradually guide the most inexperienced graphics developers from a simple render of a single triangle to complex scenes that incorporate many objects, animations and shader effects.

## Setup ##
The Getting Started guide of our SDK Browser provides step-by-step instructions to build and deploy the SDK example applications for the various support operating systems. You can find the SDK Browser [here](http://powervr-graphics.github.io/Native_SDK/SDKBrowser.html).
