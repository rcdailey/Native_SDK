			<h2>PowerVR Tools and SDK v3.5</h2>
			<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>In this release, support has been added to PVRVFrame for Android Extension Pack (AEP) as well as new hardware profiles for Dell Venue 8 3840, Lenovo K900, Google Nexus Player, Onda V972, etc. In PVRTune, a new set of counters has been defined for Series6 family to make both high-level and low-level analysis easier, for example, the counters are now categorized under Overview, GPU Advanced, Renderer, Shader, etc. PVRTrace features optimized memory usage as well as an enhanced user interface with a new draw call inspector and better render state machine analysis and browsing. In PVRTexTool, we have added support for ASTC. PVRShaderEditor now supports OpenCL profiling and disassembly. PVRHub supports 64bit platforms and also has an updated configuration file format and relaxed requirements for superuser. The SDK now provides out of the box support for Google's Android Studio IDE.</p>

				<p>PVRTuneGUI</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Fixed BRN51238. PVRTuneGUI: Connection timeout advise - "Have you remembered to use 'adb forward tcp:6520 tcp:6520' to connect to an Android device over USB?" Text is permanently visible and goes bold if the connection does not succeed in 250ms.</li>
					<li>Preferences dialog box:</li>
					<ul>

						<li>Now allows the user to specify the time range via a context menu, or the combo box. The combo box has been moved to the bottom, and inside the scroll area; this means it does not forcibly use screen space at low resolutions and can be scrolled away.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Counter Table:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Counter table now grouped as a tree view with filter options removed.</li> 
						<li>Fixed a rare crash when adding/removing columns.</li>
						<li>Groups and counter tool tips now have more info about any PID/CIDs mentioned.</li>
						<li>Enabled dynamic sorting. This keeps the default groups in a sensible order at startup, as apps start & quit.</li>
						<li>Context menu now says 'Counter Properties' rather than just 'Properties'. Also updated keyboard shortcuts via &'s.</li>
						<li>The Master table can no longer have the 'view' column disabled, this reduces counter pop.</li>
						<li>Replaced 'filtering' with a tree view:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Removed counter table 'filter' button.</li>
							<li>Default tree view grouping is by 'source'.</li>
							<li>Right-click context menu allows the grouping to be changed to 'filter', equivalent to the old filtering option.</li>
							<li>Removed 'number' column.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</ul>		
				<p>PVRPerfServer</p>
				<ul>
					<li>PVRPerfServer for Linux/Android: now outputs a warning if '/sys/kernel/debugs/pvr/gpu_tracing_on' is enabled.</li>
					<li>Linux: fixed the case where PVRPerfServer is ran as 'root' but then apps are run as a user but they can't connect via PVRScope.</li>
					<li>Command-line option '--pid' is now enabled by default. Added '--nopid' to allow it to be disabled.</li>

				</ul>
				<p>PVRTune Complete only (NDA)</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Added HW counter support for PowerVR Series7.</li>
					<li>Added support for selecting 'custom counters' (including e.g. SLC) on Rogue DDK branches that support it.</li>
					<li>Added (non selectable) data and counters for SLC read/write counters for SGX branches 1.7 and newer.</li>

					<ul>
						<li>Anti-aliasing: samples per pixel</li>
						<li>Pixel quad efficiency</li>
						<li>Shader clock cycles (pixel) per sample</li>
						<li>Iterators per sample</li>

			<h3>PVRGeoPOD v2.16.4</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Standalone: Fixed BRN53593. Texture names should now be converted to POD for Collada files exported from Maya's FBX Exporter. Between SDK 3.3 and 3.4 a fix for an unrelated issue broke a workaround for their off-specification texture exporting.</li>

			<h2>PowerVR Tools and SDK v3.4</h2>
			<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>In this release PVRShaderEditor adds the latest compilers for Series6, Series6 FP16, and Series6XT to provide more up-to-date profiling. PVRShaderEditor also adds new functionality to access the GLSL disassembly for these compilers, as well as full instruction set documentation. In addition, several performance optimizations have been made for the different utilities in the PowerVR Tools suite. New SDKs have been added including WebGL, Android 64bit and Linux MIPS. Furthermore, a fully redesigned PowerVR SDK Browser is now supplied with the distribution for improving accessibility of the SDK contents.</p>

						<li>Shader proportion: vertex.</li>
						<li>Shader proportion: compute.</li>
						<li>Vertices per batch.</li>
						<li>Shader slot scheduled count: compute.</li>
						<li>Shader slot scheduled count: pixel.</li>
						<li>Shader slot scheduled count: vertex.</li>

					</ul>
					<li>Complete build and custom counter groups:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Custom counters: editable fourth column.</li>
						<li>Rename the count modes "unary" and "binary".</li>
						<li>Added a filter input box for the first three columns.</li>
						<li>Set the stretch factors to give the rightmost two columns more space.</li>
						<li>Removed uniformItemSizes for the first list. That also affects width, which means the horizontal scroll bar wasn't appearing soon enough.</li>
						<li>Fixed tab order, and put the focus in the filter box by default.</li>
						<li>Now saves and restores the dialog's geometry each time.</li>
						<li>Now create counters for custom HW sources.</li>
						<li>BVNC string parsing. Should now handle V="cb" or V="3p" style BVNCs. When automatically creating per frame and per second counters for HW sources, now also creates a per clock counter.</li>
						<li>When automatically creating per frame and per second counters for HW sources, now also creates a raw counter. This lets you see the actual count in the time period. Perhaps useful in the counter table, but not in the graph.</li>

					<ul>
						<li>Data no longer "pauses" during periods of no GPU activity.</li>
						<li>Added the missing shader core load, for Rogue.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Counter properties docking-window:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>No longer lets the window size grow due to a long counter Name or Source string.</li>
						<li>Also sets the Name and Source strings as StatusTips (ToolTips are too distracting) - allows larger strings be read.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Added support for nested user timelines. PVRTune renders these as a "flame graph".</li>
					<li>Connection screen:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>URL buttons now automatically shrink their text to fit (lost during port to Qt).</li>
						<li>"Connect To:" box now gets the focus by default, as it should, and as it used to. Can once again simply run and press Enter to go straight to the last connection.</li>
						<li>Now convert all file path slashes to '/'. This fixes/removes the possibility of two 'matching' paths in the file history but with different slashes on Windows.</li>
						<li>Status bar: now has a visual semaphore indicating connection warnings; click to show the PVRPerfServer Details dialog box.</li>
						<li>Added more feedback to PVRPerfServer details: now shows warnings at the bottom.</li>
						<li>Complete build: additional info.</li>
						<li>Fixed some rare crashes.</li>
						<li>Main window: fixed the 'empty window' behind the splash screen during first (no preferences file) start up.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Changed the default docking-window layout:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Top Dock left to right: counter table (default top-most), search, remote editor.</li>
						<li>Bottom: Monitor (default top-most), Props, RS override, PID.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Mouse hover over the Monitor now causes counters to highlight. Also, in the bar chart style, empty components will now have a hit-test result.</li>
					<li>The Counter Table context menu now has a new option "Properties", which enables and brings the Counter Properties docking window foremost, and sets the focus to the Y-Axis input box.</li>
					<li>Graphs:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Graphs now scroll more smoothly even when received data is intermittent.</li>
						<li>Fixed an issue where start-up with a zoom value of one (1) would mean that the mouse-wheel could not be used to zoom out, but other methods could.</li>
						<li>Fixed vertical centering of timeline labels on Windows and Linux.</li>
						<li>Renderstate Override: sets vertical policy to preferred, rather than fixed. Makes it a much more polite docking window.</li>
						<li>Fixed a case where scrolled graph rendering could show pixel corruption (refresh would fix).</li>
					</ul>
					<li>PVRTune performance optimisations.</li>
					<li>Bug-fix: restore proper counter tool-tips.</li>
					<li>Updated PVRTuneComplete's welcome message in light of it being covered by the NDA licence, rather than the DDK source licence.</li>
					<li>No longer remember zoom or position between sessions. When loading from a file, automatically "view all" when complete.</li>

				</ul>
				<li>PVRPerfServer for Linux, BB10 and Android: made unnecessary and removed command line option "--disable-user-input".</li>
			</ul>
			<p>PVRScope Library</p>
			<ul>
				<li>PVRScopeComms.h:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Don't prefix strings with psz (thereby specifying NULL-terminated), when in fact there is a string-length parameter. pplSendMark() comment improved: the input string is not time-stamped, it's done internally.</li>
					<li>New class: CPPLProcessingScoped. Helper class which will send a processing begin/end pair around its scope. You would typically instantiate these at the top of a function or after the opening curly-brace of a new scope within a function.</li>
					<li>PVRScopeComms.h: updated comments; pplSendProcessingBegin() / pplSendProcessingEnd() pairs can now be nested.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>PVRScope: Headers should work with C code.</li>
				<li>PVRScopeReadCountersThenSetGroup(): removed nTimeUS parameter as it is now queried internally.</li>
				<li>Split PVRScopeReadCountersThenSetGroup() into two new functions: PVRScopeReadCounters() and PVRScopeSetGroup().</li>
				<li>PVRScopeStats: new function PVRScopeFindStandardCounter().</li>
				<li>Fix for per-render counters (per-frame were ok).</li>

					<li>PVRTrace now includes full recording capabilities on Android 4.4 (KiKat) and the handling of Android Native Buffers has been improved. Developers also now benefit from enhanced search and remote recording capabilities and complete support for OpenGL ES 3.0 API.</li>
					<li>PVRTune implements a new ‘monitor’ window which provides a simplified and high-level overview of CPU, memory and graphics loading, allowing developers to quickly isolate application bottlenecks. It also has improved highlight and selection capabilities and implements new per-PID stats.</li>
					<li>In addition, the SDK’s documentation has been comprehensively reviewed and updated.</li>
				</ul>
			<h3>Note</h3>
			Full support for the recently ratified OpenGL ES 3.1 API has been added to PVRVFrame. Please note that this support is only intended for early development, as an OpenGL ES 3.1 conformance test has not yet been released. To use it, please download the header files from the Khronos website. We will shortly release a full SDK highlighting the most important features of this new API.

					<li>PVRPerfServer can now send CPU usage info for 'interesting' PIDs that it sees: apps that connect via PVRScope, PIDs shown in HWPerf timing data, and PIDs specified on the command line. To enable it, specify "-pid" on the command line. To additionally watch specific PIDs, specify "-pid=A,B" etc.</li>
					<li>Added per-core task time counters.</li>
					<li>Added per-PID stats: TA Busy %, 3D Busy %, 2D Busy %, Compute Busy %, 3D SPM %.</li>
					<li>Dynamic counters created per PID or CID now place the PID/CID number first; gives easier sorting.</li>
					<li>CPU usage can now be sent per core and per PID.</li>
					<li>Memory usage can now be sent for the system and per PID. Added counters: Memory use, Memory total, Memory load, PID %u: Memory use.</li>
					<li>Added new docking window: Monitor. This gives a simplified 'at a glance' view of the CPU, memory and graphics loading.</li>
					<li>Fixed: When connecting, disconnecting and reconnecting, pause was enabled by default.</li>
					<li>Search window
					<ul>
						<li>The "select" tick box has been removed.</li>
						<li>Mouse-over search results now highlights the relevant time range (if any) in the graph views.</li>
						<li>Single-click on a result now pans the view, rather than panning + zooming.</li>
						<li>Double-click on a result now pans and zooms the view.</li>
						<li>Holding the Ctrl key while doing either of the above also selects the time range. (Similar to how Ctrl+click in a graph view is used to alter the selected time range).</li>
						<li>Hold Ctrl+Shift to extend the existing selection.</li>
						<li>Added View\Find - Ctrl+F now works to bring up Search (shows, raises and sets focus to the input box).</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Graph Views
					<ul>
						<li>Now display the highlighted time range.</li>
						<li>Ensure selection/highlight range draws are always at least 1 pixel wide.</li>
						<li>If there is a task under the mouse, highlight the entire time range.</li>
						<li>Ctrl must be held to modify the selection - don't suddenly allow Shift by itself to extend the selection.</li>
						<li>Ctrl+clicking on a task now sets the selection to be the entire task time-range - giving 'snap' behaviour. Additionally, hold Shift to instead extend the existing selection.</li>
					</ul>	
					</li>
					<li>Counter Table
					<ul>
						<li>Added a new counter table column: Highlight.</li>
						<li>Counter Table default columns are now: 1s, Selected, View.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Counters
					<ul>
						<li>Enable SPM counter in Developer build.</li>
						<li>Renamed some US counters to USC.</li>
						<li>Increase the maximum graph y-axis value that may be entered.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			<h3>PVRShaderEditor v2.3</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Performing a search when the ASM Output widget has focus now searches the ASM widget instead of the main editor.</li>
					<li>Deleting or moving a file which is currently open in PVRShaderEditor will now correctly prompt whether to discard the file or keep the file in the editor.</li>
					<li>Fixed bug in which re-opening the editor when closed with a blank file and the option 'Save Session' selected would display an IOError.</li>
					<li>Fixed bug which meant that PFX line cycle counts and errors were only being displayed for the entire GLSL block, rather than per-line, if the GLSL code is embedded.</li>
				</ul>
			<h3>PVRGeoPOD v2.16</h3>
				<ul>

			<p>PVRTraceGUI</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Fixed the saving of the wireframe colour to the preferences.</li>
					<li>The call summary now allows the addition of highlights to the calls in the call viewer, as well as to find all occurrences of that call using the search feature.</li>
					<li>The call summary now supports multiple selection of calls using Ctrl+left mouse click and Shift+left mouse click.</li>
					<li>It is now possible to search calls within a specific frame range and by thread.</li>
					<li>Status bar messages no longer timeout.</li>
					<li>The minimum number of characters that can now be searched for is 1.</li>
					<li>Search results can now be selected with Enter when navigating with arrow keys.</li>
					<li>Tidied up/simplified the Remote Controller interface.</li>
					<li>The default for the number of search results has been raised from 100 to 500</li>
					<li>Added the EGL_CONTEXT_PRIORITY enums as recognised values.</li>
					<li>Tweaked the Find functionality.</li>
					<li>Render targets are now listed in chronological order.</li>
					<li>The Android version of the PVRTrace libraries now export a subset of the extensions that the NDK's version of libGLESv1_CM and libGLESv2 export.</li>
					<li>Added an extra counter to the profiling that shows the total number of API calls in a frame.</li>
					<li>Modified the call summary export so the rows and columns are switched.</li>
				</ul>
			<p>PVRTrace Recorder</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Added support for recording on Android 4.4, KitKat.</li>
