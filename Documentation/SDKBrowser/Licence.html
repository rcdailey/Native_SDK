			<h2>FAQ about the SDK EULA</h2>
			<p><strong>Q1: Are there any fees associated with using the SDK?</strong></p>
			<p>No. The SDK is completely free to use for both commercial and non-commercial purposes. There are no licence, royalty or support and maintenance fees associated with our SDK.</p>
			<p><strong>Q2: Can I distribute the entire SDK?</strong></p>
			<p>No. You cannot distribute a complete standalone SDK. Only components of the SDK can be distributed.</p>
			<p><strong>Q3: If I am distributing a component of the SDK, what must I ensure?</strong></p>
			<p>You will need to ensure that the terms under which you are distributing that component of the SDK is no less restrictive than those in the SDK EULA. You also need to comply with our Attribution Requirements found in the SDK EULA. In addition, redistributing a component of the SDK makes you solely responsible for any update, support obligation or other liability that may arise from such distribution. You also cannot make any statement that your application or its performance are certified, guaranteed or otherwise endorsed by us.</p>
			<p><strong>Q4: Can I distribute SDK source code?</strong></p>
			<p>Yes. If distributing SDK source code as-is the copyright notice must be kept at the top of the source code, including the proper acknowledgement made (see Q7). However, the copyright may be removed from SDK source code that you have modified. You also need to ensure that you comply with our terms regarding the distribution of the SDK (see Q3 and the SDK EULA).</p>
			<p><strong>Q5: Can I distribute a PowerVR graphics utility binary (e.g. PVRTexLib) with my game engine/tool suite?</strong></p>
			<p>Yes, as long as the origins of the binary are not misrepresented and the licence of your product is no less permissive than those in the SDK EULA. When distributing a utility binary, you should include the proper acknowledgement (see Q6). This applies to both closed and open source projects. You also need to ensure that you comply with our terms regarding the distribution of the SDK (see Q3 and the SDK EULA).</p>
			<p><strong>Q6: How should I acknowledge SDK object code (i.e. binaries) that has been bundled with my product?</strong></p>
			<p>You will need to include the following acknowledgement: "This product includes components of the PowerVR<sup>TM</sup> SDK from Imagination Technologies Limited"</p>
			<p><strong>Q7: How should I acknowledge SDK source code that has been used to compile my product?</strong></p>
			<p>You will need to include the following acknowledgement: "This product includes components of the PowerVR<sup>TM</sup> SDK from Imagination Technologies Limited"</p>
			<p><strong>Q8: Can I manipulate an element of the SDK that has not already been made available in source code form?</strong></p>
			<p>No. You are not permitted to modify, disassemble, decompile, reverse engineer, revise or enhance the SDK, create derivative works or attempt to discover the source code for any element of the SDK not already provided in source code form.</p>
			<p><strong>Q9: Can I remove copyright notices at the top of SDK source code or included with the SDK?</strong></p>
			<p>No. You are not permitted to remove any proprietary or copyright notices on or accompanying the SDK. However, if you are integrating parts of the SDK source code into your own code, you may remove the copyright notice.</p>
			<p><strong>Q10: Can I hide the printed output of command-line utilities?</strong></p>
			<p>Yes. You can hide messages printed by our command-line tools, including copyright notices.</p>
			<p><strong>Q11: Can I incorporate or combine part of the SDK with my open source software?</strong></p>
			<p>Yes, as long as you comply with our Attribution Requirements found in the SDK EULA. However, you are not permitted to incorporate or combine the SDK with your open source software in such a way that the SDK becomes subjected to the licence obligations or other intellectual property terms that hold for that open source software.</p>
